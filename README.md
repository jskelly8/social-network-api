## Description
Challenge 18 -- NoSQL: Social Network API

This project was built in order to build an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ thoughts, and create a friend list. I used Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM, and provided my own seed data entered into Insomnia before the walkthrough video was recorded.

Since this project is back end, there will not be a live site to visit, however, you are free to test the back end and server by utilizing the program Insomnia, or MongoDB Compass, so that you can interact with the database. If you would just like to view this being done, please visit the [Usage](#usage) section to view a video walkthrough.
